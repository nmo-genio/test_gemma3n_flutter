# test_gemma3n_flutter

An educational AI assistant built with Flutter.

## Overview

This app demonstrates on‑device inference using Google's **Gemma 3n E4B** model.
It downloads the model at runtime, initializes it through Google AI Edge and
provides a simple chat style interface. Real‑time system metrics such as CPU and
memory usage, as well as tokens per second, are displayed while interacting with
the model. Riverpod is used for state management and the project is configured
for Android, iOS, web and desktop targets (AI Edge features are available on
mobile platforms).
